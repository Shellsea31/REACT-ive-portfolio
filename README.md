# Unit 20: React Portfolio

## Description

This is a react-based portfolio! Here you'll find information about me, Shelsy Barrera, some of my best work, and ways to contact me. I've got a header/nav, a footer, and component for all my pages including about, projects, and contact. Components in the main section are displayed depending on the state. You change the state every time you click a button on the navbar! My project info is displayed from an object inside of projects.json. So, I can add a new project there and it'll be added to the component no problem. It's got a polished mobile-first design. Check it out below!
